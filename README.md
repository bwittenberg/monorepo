# Monorepo

⚠️ Early Work In Progress. ⚠️
Before a 1.0.0 package release, the work is unstable and will not meet quality standards. (Why? Make it work. Make it good. Make it fast.)

Personal projects, site, and portfolio.

# Basic Roadmap (ordered)

- [x] Deploy something to bwittenberg.com
  - set up repo, configuration, and basic monorepo structure
- [ ] Make bwittenberg.com look better, and setup information architecture with about and posts
- [ ] Choose next step: Write software engineering content, build a useful component
